"We booked this 4-star hotel expecting a comfortable and high-quality stay, but our experience was extremely disappointing. What we encountered was completely unacceptable and far from what was promised. This hotel does not live up to the hype, and based on our experience, it should be avoided at all costs.
Upon arrival, the room appeared clean. However, we noticed the hair dryer was not working. We informed the staff and they assured us it would be replaced, but no one followed up, and we received nothing. We let that slide at the time.
The next morning, we left our room in a hurry to attend a function, leaving it messy. To our surprise, when we returned, the room had been cleanedeven though we had not requested housekeeping. The towels and bedding had been changed, and everything looked neatly arranged.
This would have been fine, except we soon discovered that one of our gold earrings was missing. It had been stored in a pouch along with a necklace, but only the earring was gone. We searched the entire room but couldnt find it. When we reported the issue to the staff, their response was shockingly indifferent. They admitted that similar incidents had happened before but offered no help, no apology, and no reassurance. The least they could have done was inform",1,family,3,1,3,google,2025-06,2025,booked star hotel expecting comfortable highquality stay experience extremely disappointing encountered completely unacceptable far promised hotel live hype based experience avoided costs upon arrival room appeared clean however noticed hair dryer working informed staff assured us would replaced one followed received nothing let slide time next morning left room hurry attend function leaving messy surprise returned room cleanedeven though requested housekeeping towels bedding changed everything looked neatly arranged would fine except soon discovered one gold earrings missing stored pouch along necklace earring gone searched entire room couldnt find reported issue staff response shockingly indifferent admitted similar incidents happened offered help apology reassurance least could done inform

"We booked the so-called Presidential Suite at Turmeric Hotel in Erode, paying over ?10,000 per night, expecting at least a decent level of luxury and service. What I got instead was an infuriating, substandard experience that left me completely disgusted.
Lets start with the bathtub  a key feature of the suite  which was non-functional and started clogging within hours. For a room in this price range, this is beyond unacceptable. I immediately reported the issue to the staff including the manager, only to be met with sheer indifference and zero accountability. No follow-up. No urgency. No solution. Just blank stares and an its-not-my-problem attitude.
The service here is a joke, and the so-called luxury is nothing but a cheap façade. For a hotel that claims to be premium, they cant even manage basic maintenance or professional customer service.

"Extremely Disappointed  Not Worth the Price
I recently stayed at the Turmeric Hotel in Erode, booking their Presidential Suite, expecting a premium experience given the steep price of over 10k per night. Unfortunately, the stay was a huge letdown.
One of the main attractions of the suite, the bathtub, was non-functional and even started clogging, which was completely unacceptable for a room in this category. Whats worse, when I brought this to the attention of the staff  including the manager  there was no sense of urgency or accountability. The response was indifferent at best, and the issue was never resolved during my stay.

"Stayed for one night.
Pros:
Reaching to hotel location was hassle free as connectivity to highway was good. Food was good. Breakfast buffet had ample options. Reception staff made the check in/check out process really smooth. Room was spacious and clean. Wifi speed was good.
Cons:
Didn't really live upto the expectations for a 4 star hotel. The room service can definitely be improved as we had to call thrice for every thing. The AC in the room was not working and upon complaining, they first sent a staff member who (now I know) had no clue about ACs and couldn't help. Then upon complaining again, they offered us a different room which again had the same issue i.e. the AC failed to cool down the room. We had to then somehow managed with the initial room assigned.

"Here is the pic of the clogged bathroom at a presidential suite.
Absolutely Pathetic Experience  Avoid at All Costs
If youre even considering booking this place, especially for something important  RUN. We paid over ?10,000 for a Presidential Suite and were greeted with a clogged, filthy bathroom that we had to clean ourselves after every maintenance person visited to check. Yes, you read that right  we cleaned it. So much for luxury.
When we raised this with the so-called maintenance manager, the response was laughably dismissive: ""This is the first time someones complained like this."" Excuse me? Thats your excuse? No apology, no urgency, no action.
The hotel staff, across hierarchy from manager to anybody, were rude, sarcastic and unhelpful. We had to re-explain the issue to at least six different people because no one cared enough to follow up. It was like screaming into the void. Nobody took responsibility, and worse, they behaved like it was our fault for not doing a full bathroom inspection upon check-in. Seriously?
They never fixed the issue. In fact, they made it clear we had to check out by 12 sharp  so not only did they not resolve the problem, they ensured we had to live with it during our entire stay.
So thank you, Turmeric, for turning our wedding stay into a nightmare. Your ""Presidential Suite"" experience is one I'll be warning people about for years. Zero stars if I could.
P.s. we were not the first time customers, we almost booked 30+ rooms here in the last 6 months for the relatives since it's super close to our house",1,couple,1,1,2,google,2025-05,2025,pic clogged bathroom presidential suite absolutely pathetic experience avoid costs youre even considering booking place especially something important run paid presidential suite greeted clogged filthy bathroom clean every maintenance person visited check yes read right cleaned much luxury raised socalled maintenance manager response laughably dismissive first time someones complained like excuse thats excuse apology urgency action hotel staff across hierarchy manager anybody rude sarcastic unhelpful reexplain issue least six different people one cared enough follow like screaming void nobody took responsibility worse behaved like fault full bathroom inspection upon checkin seriously never fixed issue fact made clear check sharp resolve problem ensured live entire stay thank turmeric turning wedding stay nightmare presidential suite experience one ill warning people years zero stars could ps first time customers almost booked rooms last months relatives since super close house

"The Short Version: Staying at Hotel Turmeric was a bit of a mixed bag. The bed was comfortable, and the breakfast was great, which I really liked. But I got hit with an unexpected extra fee when I checked in because the booking wasn't clear, and they were missing some basics I'd expect, like a hand shower in the bathroom and, importantly for me, any way to charge my electric car.

"We booked this 4-star hotel expecting a comfortable and high-quality stay, but our experience was extremely disappointing. What we encountered was completely unacceptable and far from what was promised. This hotel does not live up to the hype, and based on our experience, it should be avoided at all costs.

Upon arrival, the room appeared clean. However, we noticed the hair dryer was not working. We informed the staff and they assured us it would be replaced, but no one followed up, and we received nothing. We let that slide at the time.

The next morning, we left our room in a hurry to attend a function, leaving it messy. To our surprise, when we returned, the room had been cleanedeven though we had not requested housekeeping. The towels and bedding had been changed, and everything looked neatly arranged.

This would have been fine, except we soon discovered that one of our gold earrings was missing. It had been stored in a pouch along with a necklace, but only the earring was gone. We searched the entire room but couldnt find it. When we reported the issue to the staff, their response was shockingly indifferent. They admitted that similar incidents had happened before but offered no help, no apology, and no reassurance. The least they could have done was inform us about a Do Not Disturb or room cleaning optionnone of which was communicated.

To make things worse, our experience at the hotel restaurant was underwhelming. While the food itself was decent, the service was extremely slow. Although we arrived a bit late, the staff seemed rushed and eager to wrap up for the night, which came off as unprofessional and unwelcoming.

Overall, this hotel failed on multiple frontsservice, professionalism, and most importantly, guest safety. I would strongly advise against staying here. Book this hotel only if you're prepared for a frustrating experience or the potential loss of your valuables",1,family,3,1,3,trip advisor,2025-05,2025,booked star hotel expecting comfortable highquality stay experience extremely disappointing encountered completely unacceptable far promised hotel live hype based experience avoided costs upon arrival room appeared clean however noticed hair dryer working informed staff assured us would replaced one followed received nothing let slide time next morning left room hurry attend function leaving messy surprise returned room cleanedeven though requested housekeeping towels bedding changed everything looked neatly arranged would fine except soon discovered one gold earrings missing stored pouch along necklace earring gone searched entire room couldnt find reported issue staff response shockingly indifferent admitted similar incidents happened offered help apology reassurance least could done inform us disturb room cleaning optionnone communicated make things worse experience hotel restaurant underwhelming food decent service extremely slow although arrived bit late staff seemed rushed eager wrap night came unprofessional unwelcoming overall hotel failed multiple frontsservice professionalism importantly guest safety would strongly advise staying book hotel youre prepared frustrating experience potential loss valuables

A lovely bonus was the complimentary multi-cuisine breakfast the next morning, which offered something for every palate  from traditional Indian to continental options.

Staff were courteous, attentive, and made sure our event went smoothly. Would highly recommend this place for both family stays and events.
