"We booked this 4-star hotel expecting a comfortable and high-quality stay, but our experience was extremely disappointing. What we encountered was completely unacceptable and far from what was promised. This hotel does not live up to the hype, and based on our experience, it should be avoided at all costs.
Upon arrival, the room appeared clean. However, we noticed the hair dryer was not working. We informed the staff and they assured us it would be replaced, but no one followed up, and we received nothing. We let that slide at the time.
The next morning, we left our room in a hurry to attend a function, leaving it messy. To our surprise, when we returned, the room had been cleanedeven though we had not requested housekeeping. The towels and bedding had been changed, and everything looked neatly arranged.
This would have been fine, except we soon discovered that one of our gold earrings was missing. It had been stored in a pouch along with a necklace, but only the earring was gone. We searched the entire room but couldnt find it. When we reported the issue to the staff, their response was shockingly indifferent. They admitted that similar incidents had happened before but offered no help, no apology, and no reassurance. The least they could have done was inform",1,Jun-25,family,3.0,1.0,3.0,google

"We booked the so-called Presidential Suite at Turmeric Hotel in Erode, paying over ?10,000 per night, expecting at least a decent level of luxury and service. What I got instead was an infuriating, substandard experience that left me completely disgusted.
Lets start with the bathtub  a key feature of the suite  which was non-functional and started clogging within hours. For a room in this price range, this is beyond unacceptable. I immediately reported the issue to the staff including the manager, only to be met with sheer indifference and zero accountability. No follow-up. No urgency. No solution. Just blank stares and an its-not-my-problem attitude.
The service here is a joke, and the so-called luxury is nothing but a cheap façade. For a hotel that claims to be premium, they cant even manage basic maintenance or professional customer service.
Do not waste your time or money on this place. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to my worst enemy.",1,May-25,family,1.0,1.0,2.0,google
"Extremely Disappointed  Not Worth the Price
I recently stayed at the Turmeric Hotel in Erode, booking their Presidential Suite, expecting a premium experience given the steep price of over 10k per night. Unfortunately, the stay was a huge letdown.
One of the main attractions of the suite, the bathtub, was non-functional and even started clogging, which was completely unacceptable for a room in this category. Whats worse, when I brought this to the attention of the staff  including the manager  there was no sense of urgency or accountability. The response was indifferent at best, and the issue was never resolved during my stay.
For a hotel that claims to offer luxury, basic functionality and service standards were shockingly poor. I would not recommend this property to anyone.",1,May-25,solo,1.0,1.0,1.0,google
"Stayed for one night.
Pros:
Reaching to hotel location was hassle free as connectivity to highway was good. Food was good. Breakfast buffet had ample options. Reception staff made the check in/check out process really smooth. Room was spacious and clean. Wifi speed was good.
Cons:
Didn't really live upto the expectations for a 4 star hotel. The room service can definitely be improved as we had to call thrice for every thing. The AC in the room was not working and upon complaining, they first sent a staff member who (now I know) had no clue about ACs and couldn't help. Then upon complaining again, they offered us a different room which again had the same issue i.e. the AC failed to cool down the room. We had to then somehow managed with the initial room assigned. The TV given was a smart TV but it wasn't possible to connect it to Wifi.",4,Jun-25,family,3.0,2.0,5.0,google
"Here is the pic of the clogged bathroom at a presidential suite.
Absolutely Pathetic Experience  Avoid at All Costs
If youre even considering booking this place, especially for something important  RUN. We paid over ?10,000 for a Presidential Suite and were greeted with a clogged, filthy bathroom that we had to clean ourselves after every maintenance person visited to check. Yes, you read that right  we cleaned it. So much for luxury.
When we raised this with the so-called maintenance manager, the response was laughably dismissive: ""This is the first time someones complained like this."" Excuse me? Thats your excuse? No apology, no urgency, no action.
The hotel staff, across hierarchy from manager to anybody, were rude, sarcastic and unhelpful. We had to re-explain the issue to at least six different people because no one cared enough to follow up. It was like screaming into the void. Nobody took responsibility, and worse, they behaved like it was our fault for not doing a full bathroom inspection upon check-in. Seriously?
They never fixed the issue. In fact, they made it clear we had to check out by 12 sharp  so not only did they not resolve the problem, they ensured we had to live with it during our entire stay.
So thank you, Turmeric, for turning our wedding stay into a nightmare. Your ""Presidential Suite"" experience is one I'll be warning people about for years. Zero stars if I could.
P.s. we were not the first time customers, we almost booked 30+ rooms here in the last 6 months for the relatives since it's super close to our house",1,May-25,couple,1.0,1.0,2.0,google
"Extremely disappointed for how badly the hotel and services have gone down. The room was not properly cleaned while we checked in, AC was not working, we had to shift our rooms twice, bathrooms were not clean, their breakfast spread use to be good but now it has terribly gone down in quality. I would never ever recommend this place to anyone.",1,May-25,,1.0,1.0,1.0,google
"The Short Version: Staying at Hotel Turmeric was a bit of a mixed bag. The bed was comfortable, and the breakfast was great, which I really liked. But I got hit with an unexpected extra fee when I checked in because the booking wasn't clear, and they were missing some basics I'd expect, like a hand shower in the bathroom and, importantly for me, any way to charge my electric car. So, even with the good bits, it ended up feeling too expensive for what I got.

"Hotel Turmeric stands out as a gem in the heart of Thindal, Erode, offering a delightful blend of modern ambiance and authentic South Indian hospitality. The moment you step in, you're greeted with a clean and tastefully designed interior that exudes warmth. Whether you're visiting for a quick lunch or a family dinner, the peaceful setting and courteous staff make it a memorable dining experience.
The food at Hotel Turmeric is a true celebration of flavor. Their menu features a wide range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, each prepared with a focus on freshness and quality. Signature items like their biryanis, dosas, and flavorful gravies leave a lasting impression. The presentation of the food is elegant, and portion sizes are generous, making it excellent value for money.
What truly elevates Hotel Turmeric is their commitment to customer satisfaction. The staff are polite, attentive, and quick to accommodate special requests. The restaurant maintains high standards of hygiene and ensures a comfortable experience for every guest. Whether you're a local or a traveler passing through Erode, Hotel Turmeric is a must-visit destination for an unforgettable meal.",5,May-25,couple,5.0,5.0,5.0,google

the booking done for a friend at the presidential suite has left us very sore after a very poor stay and experience with clogged bathroom drains and a very nonchalant hospitality.

"Me and my friends booked rooms here at Turmeric hotel only after looking at the roof top swimming pool. But, post booking, We are unable to use the Pool even once..
The hotel management illegally, has let out the Swimming Pool access for outsiders for rental purposes to get more money, it's become their side business.
Many outside People are using the Swimming pool for their coaching/training purposes.
When would people like us, who paid a lot of money and booked rooms for friends and family would really start to use the Swimming pool then ?

"My parents' recent stay at your Hotel was nothing short of a nightmare, primarily due to the appalling behavior of the maintenance staff. What was supposed to be a relaxing visit turned into a distressing ordeal, and I am utterly disgusted by the way they were treated.
Upon arrival, my parents discovered a significant issue with the air conditioning in their room. After several calls to the front desk, a maintenance worker finally arrived. His name is Vivek anandhan .This is where the problems escalated. Instead of addressing the issue professionally, the staff member was dismissive and condescending. He spoke to my elderly parents in a rude and impatient manner, completely disregarding their concerns.The air conditioning remained faulty throughout their stay, and the maintenance worker's unacceptable behavior was intolerable.This experience has left my parents deeply upset and frustrated.His behavior has ruined my parents' vacation.",1,Apr-25,family,2.0,2.0,2.0,google

We had an awful experience at this hotel. After parking our car, we discovered it was damaged.

"We booked this 4-star hotel expecting a comfortable and high-quality stay, but our experience was extremely disappointing. What we encountered was completely unacceptable and far from what was promised. This hotel does not live up to the hype, and based on our experience, it should be avoided at all costs.

Upon arrival, the room appeared clean. However, we noticed the hair dryer was not working. We informed the staff and they assured us it would be replaced, but no one followed up, and we received nothing. We let that slide at the time.

The next morning, we left our room in a hurry to attend a function, leaving it messy. To our surprise, when we returned, the room had been cleanedeven though we had not requested housekeeping. The towels and bedding had been changed, and everything looked neatly arranged.

This would have been fine, except we soon discovered that one of our gold earrings was missing. It had been stored in a pouch along with a necklace, but only the earring was gone. We searched the entire room but couldnt find it. When we reported the issue to the staff, their response was shockingly indifferent. They admitted that similar incidents had happened before but offered no help, no apology, and no reassurance. The least they could have done was inform us about a Do Not Disturb or room cleaning optionnone of which was communicated.

To make things worse, our experience at the hotel restaurant was underwhelming. While the food itself was decent, the service was extremely slow. Although we arrived a bit late, the staff seemed rushed and eager to wrap up for the night, which came off as unprofessional and unwelcoming.

Overall, this hotel failed on multiple frontsservice, professionalism, and most importantly, guest safety. I would strongly advise against staying here. Book this hotel only if you're prepared for a frustrating experience or the potential loss of your valuables",1,May-25,family,3.0,1.0,3.0,trip advisor

The banquet arrangements were spot on. The lunch buffet was exceptional  a delightful mix of Indian (North and South) as well as Western cuisine. Every dish was full of flavor, fresh, and beautifully presented.

A lovely bonus was the complimentary multi-cuisine breakfast the next morning, which offered something for every palate  from traditional Indian to continental options.

Staff were courteous, attentive, and made sure our event went smoothly. Would highly recommend this place for both family stays and events.
